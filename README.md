## Basic Flutter layout concepts
Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter UI.

### Row and Column classes
- Row and Column can have multiple widgets inside called children : []
- Row lays out its widgets horizontally
- Column lays out its widgets vertically.

### Flexible Widgets
The Flexible widget wraps a widget, so the widget becomes resizable. When the Flexible widget wraps a widget, the widget becomes the Flexible widgetâ€™s child and is considered flexible.
- flex: determine priority of space
- fit : determines whether a Flexible widget fills all of its extra space.

### Expanded widget
Expanded widget can wrap a widget and force the widget to fill extra space

### SizedBox widget
One of two ways to creating extra dimensions.

### Spacer widget
To create space between widgets.
